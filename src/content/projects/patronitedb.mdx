PatroniteDB is an online database that provides in-depth insights into
Patronite creators and trends. I developed it as a hobby project using Nest.js
and SQL for the back end and React for the front end.

## Background and goals

Since [Patronite](https://patronite.pl/) is one of the most popular
platforms for subscription services in Poland, I wanted to provide an overview
of all its goings-on such as the most popular creators, highest-earning
creators, new creators joining. Inspired by [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/), I went on to create an online
database of all things Patronite that would enable the users to:

- Get insights into new, trending, and the most popular creators at a glance
- Access and filter creator charts by number of subscribers, revenue,
- Review a specific creators' stats and compare them over time with tables and
  charts

To achieve consistency, reusability, and a user-friendly design, I
chose React and Material UI. Since the project involved multiple
complex queries and countless dynamic routes, I opted for two Tanstack
solutions that integrated seamlessly with each other — Tanstack Query
and Tanstack Router.

To retrieve data from the Patronite website, I built a Node.js crawler
— NestJS made the process quick, easy, and enjoyable. From then on, I
stored my data in InfluxDB and queried it using SQL.

At its initial stage, the website is deployed with Vercel, but I also
containerised it with Docker to ensure consistency and scalability as
the project grows.

### Performance vs. flexibility

The aim of the website was to provide a wide range of functionalities and
maximum flexibility to the users. This, however, involved many continuous
user-triggered data queries and could end up affecting loading speed. To
optimise performance, I made use of Tanstack Query's extensive fetching and
rendering functionalities, such as prefetching, suspense queries, or infinite
queries.
