Visit Jericho is a travel guide website for the city of Jericho,
developed on the request of the non-governmental organisation Mosaic
Centre Jericho. I designed and built this website from scratch using
Next.js, TailwindCSS, GraphQL, and WordPress.

## Background and goals

When I came across Mosaic Centre Jericho's project brief on the Tech To
The Rescue website, I got excited about the possibility of helping a
passionate travel guide promote his city. Since Mosaic Centre Jericho
created the content, I had full control over the design and development
process and I wanted to make sure that the site balanced a modern feel for
the users with the familiarity and ease of use for the website
administrators. In short, I had three main goals in mind:

- Speed, performance, and SEO optimisation to provide the best user
  experience
- Headless CMS for the best performance and flexibility
- WordPress integration to allow the organisation to easily update the website in their familiar WordPress environment

To meet the project goals, I had to settle on a modern and reliable
tech stack. WordPress as the CMS was a given, so I began a search for
a compatible front-end/full-stack framework. With the Next.js App
Router, I was able easily fetch the CMS data with GraphQL, while
optimising performance.

As for the design, Tailwind CSS made styling both quick and consistent
and worked seamlessly with component libraries such as Material
Tailwind or Radix UI.

To test my code, I used Jest for unit testing (aside from the
not-yet-supported server components) and Playwright for E2E testing. I
also chose GitHub and GitHub actions for CI/CD, which allowed me to
introduce feature branches and run tests on commits.

Netlify's integration with Next.js made deployment a breeze, and
Amazon Lightsail allowed us to link our WordPress instance in minutes.
To further optimise media, we also used Amazon Cloudfront and S3.

### Code organisation

As for code organisation, I prioritised clarity and reusability. I
used the Material Tailwind component library to ensure consistency.
Since I needed to make some tweaks to meet the specific needs of the
design, I created component directories with varying scopes next to my
Next.js route directories.

### Integrating different technologies

Some of the services we initially considered due to competetive
pricing had not yet introduced full integration with RSC and the App
Router. To take advantage of Netlify's uniquely amazing integration
without sacrificing cost-efficiency, I lowered the cost on the
deployment side by pre-optimising images with Amazon Cloudfront and
S3.
