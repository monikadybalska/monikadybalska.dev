    <h2>Background and goals</h2>
    <p>
      When I came across Mosaic Centre Jericho's project brief on the Tech To
      The Rescue website, I got excited about the possibility of helping a
      passionate travel guide promote his city. Since Mosaic Centre Jericho
      created the content, I had full control over the design and development
      process and I wanted to make sure that the site balanced a modern feel for
      the users with the familiarity and ease of use for the website
      administrators. In short, I had three main goals in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Speed, performance, and SEO optimisation to provide the best user
        experience
      </li>
      <li>Headless CMS for the best performance and flexibility</li>
      <li>
        WordPress integration to allow the organisation to easily update the
        website in their familiar WordPress environment
      </li>
    </ul>

          To meet the project goals, I had to settle on a modern and reliable
          tech stack. WordPress as the CMS was a given, so I began a search for
          a compatible frontend/fullstack framework. With the Next.js App
          Router, I was able easily fetch the CMS data with GraphQL, while
          optimising performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the design, Tailwind CSS made styling both quick and consistent
          and worked seamlessly with component libraries such as Material
          Tailwind or Radix UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          To test my code, I used Jest for unit testing (aside from the
          not-yet-supported server components) and Playwright for E2E testing. I
          also chose GitHub and GitHub actions for CI/CD, which allowed me to
          introduce feature branches and run tests on commits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Netlify's integration with Next.js made deployment a breeze, and
          Amazon Lightsail allowed us to link our WordPress instance in minutes.
          To further optimise media, we also used Amazon Cloudfront and S3.

        <h3>Code organisation</h3>
        <p>
          As for code organisation, I prioritised clarity and reusability. I
          used the Material Tailwind component library to ensure consistency.
          Since I needed to make some tweaks to meet the specific needs of the
          design, I created component directories with varying scopes next to my
          Next.js route directories.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h3>Integrating different technologies</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the services we initially considered due to competetive
          pricing had not yet introduced full integration with RSC and the App
          Router. To take advantage of Netlify's uniquely amazing integration
          without sacrificing cost-efficiency, I lowered the cost on the
          deployment side by pre-optimising images with Amazon Cloudfront and
          S3.
